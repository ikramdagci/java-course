# Java Course

This repository contains sample codes used in a Java training course I taught. It serves as a valuable resource for course participants and anyone who wants to review the topics covered in the course and enhance their Java programming skills.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine and run the following command to build the project using Maven:

```mvn clean install```


After successfully building the project, you can run the `main` method of the desired `Driver.java` class to see the examples in action.

## Content

This repository contains code examples covering a range of Java topics, including:

- Java data types and operators
- Conditional statements and loops
- Classes, objects, and inheritance
- Abstract classes and interfaces
- Polymorphism and generics
- Collections (ArrayList, LinkedList, HashMap, etc.)
- Exception handling
- File reading and writing operations
- Multithreading and synchronization
- JPA and Hibernate

The examples are organized into packages that correspond to these different Java programming concepts.

Feel free to explore the code and learn from the examples!
